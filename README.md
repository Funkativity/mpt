[Motion Planning Templates (MPT)](http://robotics.cs.unc.edu/mpt)
===============================

[Motion Planning Templates (MPT)](http://robotics.cs.unc.edu/mpt) is a collection of C++ template classes for fast, parallel, robot-specific motion planning.  MPT uses C++ templates to generate and optimize motion planners at compile-time.  The result is that MPT planners are fast, have reduced memory requirements, predictable throughput, and reduced memory fragmentation.  It aims to be as efficient as if one were to custom write a planner for a single robot.
